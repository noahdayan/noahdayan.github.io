			      Just as you wouldn’t dig out a corpse from its grave, few would dare to jam with the dead. Nevertheless, Pink Floyd’s remaining members, guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason decided to honor founding member and keyboardist Richard Wright, who passed away in 2008, in their latest release. <em>The Endless River</em> draws from extra material recorded by Wright during the 1993 sessions of their previous album <em>The Division Bell</em>.<br>
			      <br>
			      If you admire Pink Floyd for their concept album masterpieces like <em>The Dark Side Of The Moon</em> and <em>The Wall</em> or their lengthy psychedelic gems such as “Echoes” and “Shine On Your Crazy Diamonds”, you’re in for a surprise. Don’t expect too much lyrical songwriting or storytelling but rather endless instrumental jams of ambient music led by the iconic guitar leads of Gilmour, the simple yet pulse-driven drum beats by Mason along with the magically hypnotic piano melodies and synth pads of Wright.<br>
			      <br>
			      Even though, the sound of Pink Floyd is instantly recognizable, a core element is missing. Without Roger Waters, bassist of Pink Floyd since its beginnings in 1965 until 1985, the album tells a discordant story that might as well be used as a film score. The songwriting components, the vocal inputs and bass lines of Waters have been the helpless slivers that empowered a cohesive band as a whole, before this current Gilmour-led era.<br>
			      <br>
			      It is unfortunate to discover that the best bits of <em>The Endless River</em> were used in the album previews shared on social medias prior to the album release, just as a bad trailer would reveal everything there is to see in a movie. At least they can be used as ringtones right away.<br>
			      <br>
			      The album is divided into four movements, each of them strangely and awkwardly familiar to a previous Floyd release, which doesn’t help in procuring the awe that one might expect when discovering new content from a favorite artist. Or would fans rather have them never change musical directions in their careers?<br>
			      <br>
			      The album opens on an atemporal track, naturally confessing its similitude to the beginning of “Shine On Your Crazy Diamonds”. Indeed, “It’s What We Do” suggests both the legacy and the band’s driving force as a mere monotonous activity lacking originality and passion.<br>
			      <br>
			      The record then shifts into an interesting odd-time signature synth pattern, but the rest of the movement in “Skins” is full of nostalgia for <em>A Saucerful Of Secrets</em>, an earlier album with a psychedelic vibe influenced by Syd Barrett, one of the founding members and songwriter of Pink Floyd who left the band in 1968 due to mental illness. “Anisina” is simple yet truly beautiful if it hadn’t been for the same string patterns taken from “Comfortably Numb”.<br>
			      <br>
			      The third side, or should I call it the Waters side, replicates two distinctive creative processes from <em>The Wall</em>. The splitting of “Allons-Y” into parts and its galloping pulse coincidently recalls “Another Brick In The Wall” along with the guitar riff that instantly evokes “Run Like Hell”, both of them written by Waters in his 1979 rock opera.<br>
			      <br>
			      Fortunately, the last and best cut of the album “Louder Than Words”, the only non-instrumental track of the release, sets the bar higher thanks to the lyrics written by Gilmour’s wife and novelist, Polly Samson. Although, the song seems to be an extract from <em>The Division Bell</em> merged with the guitar solo from “Comfortably Numb”, one of Gilmour’s finest work often considered one of the best solos of all time, it delivers a clear message with conviction.<br>
			      <br>
			      <em>The Endless River</em> succeeds in transporting the listener through some of Pink Floyd’s distinctive eras as a compilation of old songs or a reissue, but hardly as an album with brand new solid material. Currently in a vulnerable state of collapse, Pink Floyd failed to provide original compositions worthy of their name and missed the opportunity to praise Wright’s work.<br>
			      <br>
			      Overall, the Wright soul is missing.

		          For Better Or For Music

		      		Canadian singer-songwriter Jon Davis launches his new music video “Better” from his second album <em>Open Shore</em>.<hr>
		      	</h4>
		      	<h3 class="text-justify">
			      <small>
			      A classically trained singer from Montreal, Jon Davis decided to incorporate his traumatic past as a positive fuel to his new musical endeavours. Suffering from a brain injury in 2006, Davis recollects the challenges of his recovery in his debut album <em>Golden Hue</em> released in 2009.<br>
			      <br>
			      “When I was recovering I wrote most of the songs of my first album. I was very depressed, anxious and scared that I wouldn’t fully recover. Prior to that I had a lead role in a professional musical theater production but I was forced to reconsider everything. I have that injury to thank in a way for making me a singer-songwriter and decide to go and write the album.” recalled Davis.<br>
			      <br>
			      Although his first creation mainly focused on his personal adventures, he bounced back in 2013 with <em>Open Shore</em>, an altruistic album sharing his recovery as an advice to mental freedom; ultimately a remedy to get better and positively enjoy the open world.<br>
			      <br>
			      “This album’s really been about overcoming obstacles, and making a decision to be happy. You are living in some sort of crazy sinking ship, but somehow you break free and you’re going towards this huge wide open shore of possibilities. It’s kind of an inspiration album trying to help people in some way, but also helping myself.” explained Davis.<br>
			      <br>
			      The songwriter had always wanted to be a musician from his early ages. He draws his inspirations from multiple musical genres ranging from Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, Jazz to even Classical. Some of his most praised artists include legendary Rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, Folk singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and Pop giants the Beatles.<br>
			      <br>
			      “I really got into blues and classic rock. My idol was Jimi Hendrix. I was also a really big fan of Led Zeppelin and covered their songs live. I used to do a lot of guitar solos, and wanted to be a guitarist not a singer. After my set, I was going up to my guitarist friends saying ‘What did you think of my guitar solo?’” admitted Davis.<br>
			      <br>
			      Even though he used to dream of becoming a guitar hero in his teens, his peers would exclusively compliment his singing everytime. He eventually became self-aware of his singing talent and decided to take his chance in music as a singer for good.<br>
			      <br>
			      “Every time I played live, people would always comment about my singing, and naturally people were pushing me towards that direction because I was better at that.” revealed Davis.<br>
			      <br>
			      Indeed, his vocal talents have been doubtlessly showcased during his last performance at La Sala Rossa. The show underwent in an intimate yet cozy atmosphere with Davis backed up by his bandmates on guitar, bass and drums. His compositions meshed a good variety of moods and instrumentation along with occasional surprises in the course of the act.<br>
			      <br>
			      On top of Davis switching effortlessly between piano, acoustic and electric guitars, he engaged the audience by inviting a dancer onto the stage to perform over an upbeat tune. The show followed by a duet with a cellist for one of his folk songs. He consequently embodied a multi-faceted character comparable to a Sir Elton John burst out singing on the piano just as an alternative rock band frontman rocking out.<br>
			      <br>
			      Jon Davis’ new music video “Better” features the same female dancer as in the show, who serves as a metaphor for change. Additionally, an interesting gradation from black and white to color graphically depicts a better growing and evolving state of mind.<br>
			      <br>
			      The difficulties of a musician trying to pierce its way through the crowd may be a common stereotype nowadays among the music industry. However, Jon Davis points out the importance of surrounding support and one’s love for music as a means of personal fulfillment.<br>
			      <br>
			      “If I can say one thing, whatever you do, just go out there with guns blazing and kick ass as hard as you can in every way. We all know hundreds of unbelievable unknown artists, but they don’t have a team. Get a team. Otherwise, you end up being a beautiful flower way out in the forest that no one is ever going to see. No one goes out to that part of the forest. You need somebody saying ‘You gotta see this, over here, yeah, no, left, next to the tree there.’”

		          James Brown and Chuck Berry Have a Son: He's a Troublemaker

		      		Vintage Trouble, the American blues rock band, stormed through Montreal last Friday at Café Campus.<hr>
		      	</h4>
		      	<h3 class="text-justify">
			      <small>
			      You might have caught Vintage Trouble’s energetic performances during last summer’s Montreal Jazzfest or as a supporting act of Rock giants, The Who. Formed in Hollywood in 2010, the quartet from California screams the music of the 60s. You can think of them as James Brown meeting Chuck Berry. They mesh good ol’ rock n’ roll with some soul, blues and R&B roots, resulting in a surprisingly bombastic new musical genre.<br>
			      <br>
			      Lead by singer Ty Taylor’s astonishing voice and Nalle Colt’s bluesy electric guitar riffs, the band takes you back to the 1960s resurrecting the music that made people twist.<br>
			      <br>
			      From the very first opening song of the night, Vintage Trouble took control of the entire crowd and space at the Cafe Campus. Despite the usual age demographic associated with the venue, baby boomers invaded the bar and shamelessly rocked their socks off; unlike our generation who just bop heads or grind booties in clubs.<br>
			      <br>
			      The highly charismatic singer showcased neither fear nor timidity on stage. He naturally bonded with the audience and used all possible means to make the show engaging and entertaining. Stepping in the crowd and singing from the balcony were some of the many tricks up his sleeve.<br>
			      <br>
			      It is fairly obvious that the pace of the show was carefully thought out. Energetic songs were spaced out with acoustic sessions and the show’s mood swings were transitioned with unexpected surprises, such as additional performers invited onto the stage. Symbolising lust in the song “Jezzebella”, a local female burlesque dancer made a shocking appearance.<br>
			      <br>
			      Fans — nicknamed the “Troublemakers” — and first-time attendees were also taken aback by the band’s vigorous performance of “Blues Hand Me Down” — a fast-paced song with lyrics retracing the roots of blues. Poignant emotions of stories that genuinely affect relationships between human beings are shared between performers and spectators in songs such as “Nobody Told Me” and “Total Strangers”.<br>
			      <br>
			      It is somewhat reassuring that in a world dominated by EDM, we still find a few gems who have a strong desire to revive music created with real instruments. It is unfortunate that our generation doesn’t express further interest in the history and origins of popular music.<br>
			      <br>
			      The Cali band kicked off their North-American <em>Swing House Sessions</em> tour with a setlist of new acoustic compositions found on the latest EP <em>The Swing House Acoustic Sessions</em> released this year, along with acoustic arrangements of previously recorded electric tunes from their debut album <em>The Bomb Shelter Sessions</em> released in 2012.<br>
			      <br>
			      If you haven’t already seen their performance on the “Late Show with David Letterman”, check it out, it surely is worth the procrastination.
